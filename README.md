The purpose of this project was to create a retirement calculator web application for Self Financial Inc, a fintech company based in Austin, TX. This client's requirements were that the project needed to calculate a user's retirement savings based on provided inputs such as age and salary.

Taxes and IRS Contribution Limits are NOT
factored into any of these calculations. For example,
this calculator does not take into account whether
contributions are pre-tax as in a traditional IRA or
post-tax as in a ROTH IRA.

• Mandatory disbursements and other regulations
are not accounted for.

• Results are only rough estimates, largely because
of uncertainty in the rates of return, inflation, future
salary, willpower to continue saving, unexpected life
events, and other assumptions.

• Interest compounds based on the number of 
Payments per Year.
